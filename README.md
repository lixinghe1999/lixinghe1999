# Hi everyone :wave:

I'm Lixing He, a PhD student from [AIoT Lab](http://aiot.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) 

## Overview
I am a researcher in Mobile Computing and Internet of Things. Specially, I am interested in acoustic sensing and navigation, multi-modal sensor fusion.
